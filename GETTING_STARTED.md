## 📂 What You'll Find

Each week's branch contains:
- 📖 **Lesson files** - Day by day Python/Linux/Web lessons
- 💻 **Exercises** - Practice problems for each lesson
- 🎯 **Final Project Starter Code** - Your starting template
- 📝 **README** - Detailed information about that week

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Branches

If you accidentally switched branches or want to view other weeks:

```bash
git branch -a                  # See all available branches
git checkout week-1            # Switch to week-1
git checkout week-2            # Switch to week-2
git checkout week-3            # Switch to week-3
```

---

## ✅ Checking Your Current Branch

To see which week/branch you're currently on:

```bash
git branch
```

The branch with an asterisk (*) is your current location.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Only access your current week's branch** - Week 2 content won't be available until Week 2 starts
- **Don't modify** the branch structure - just work within your week's folder
- **When submitting:** Email your completed files to the instructors
