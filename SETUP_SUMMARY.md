## 🔒 Week 2 & 3 (Scaffolding - Content Placeholders)

**week-2 branch:**
- README_WEEK2.md with content preview
- Placeholder files to maintain structure

**week-3 branch:**
- README_WEEK3.md with content preview
- Placeholder files to maintain structure

**Why:** Prevents students from accessing content before they're ready, while showing them what's coming.

---

## 🎯 How This Simplifies Student Experience

1. **No complex git workflows** - Just `git checkout week-1`
2. **Clear content progression** - Each week is isolated in its branch
3. **No accidental access** - Students can't see next week's content
4. **Professional structure** - Looks like real-world project setup
5. **Easy updates** - You can push updates to each branch independently

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Week 1 (Starts Feb 1)
1. Share repo link with students
2. Include instructions from `GETTING_STARTED.md`
3. Students clone and `git checkout week-1`
4. They follow lessons in order

### For Week 2 (Starts Feb 8)
1. Add complete Linux/security content to week-2 branch
2. Update README_WEEK2.md with actual lessons
3. Notify students: "Your next week's content is ready!"
4. Push updates: `git push origin week-2`

### For Week 3 (Starts Feb 15)
Same process as Week 2
