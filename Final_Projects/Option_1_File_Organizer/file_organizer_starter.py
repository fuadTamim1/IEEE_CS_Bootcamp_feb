WEEK 1 FINAL PROJECT - OPTION 1: Smart File Organizer
=======================================================

Base Functionality:
- Sort files by extension into organized folders

Extensions (choose at least 2):
✓ Sort by creation date
✓ Auto-rename files
✓ Create folders dynamically
✓ Ignore system files
✓ Display summary report
✓ Show execution time

Starter Code - Build upon this!

# NEXT STEPS TO EXTEND THIS PROJECT:
# 1. Add date-based sorting
# 2. Add auto-renaming functionality
# 3. Add summary report
# 4. Add execution time tracking
# 5. Add error handling with try-except
# 6. Add logging to a file
# 7. Add command-line arguments
